### Goals

- Reduce "time-to-science" for researchers
- Improve mechanisms for crediting different research outputs
- Democratize scientific software

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Main Components

- Education & Outreach (this workshop)
- Throughput Database ([database snapshots](https://figshare.com/collections/Throughput_Database_Snapshots/5075912))
- Earth Science Cookbook ([throughputdb.com](https://throughputdb.com))

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Education & Outreach

- We are good at doing research
- We are not often good at documenting it ([Lee 2018](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006561))
- We are finding new uses for old research

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Education & Outreach (pt 2)

- To avoid inequity in access Throughput is making tools accessible to a broader range of researchers
- We are providing new avenues to discover workflows in the geosciences
- We are providing new ways of annotating data to help improve the social dissemination of knowledge.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Throughput Database

- Making connections

  - Between data & software
  - Between data & the literature
  - Between the literature & software
  - Between grants, data, software & the literature
  - Among researchers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Earth Science Cookbook

- [throughputdb.com](https://throughputdb.com)
- Keyword and full-text searches for databases and the scripts that use them.
  > How do I connect climate and soils data?
  > How do I work with data from a database?
